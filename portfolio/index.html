<p>Hi There! My name is Raghav and I would like to tell you a little bit about myself. First of all, I am pretty excited to be part of the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. Like a lot of people in this class, if you had asked me 10 years ago what I'd be doing now, I would have never said learning to code. I went to NYU and majored in Neural Science and then did my Masters in Biomedical Science at Rutgers. I would like to do something entrepreneurial and create an app/website/software program with the skills I obtain from this class along with my background in the Life Sciences </p>
<p id="secondpara">I am a big sports fan. My favorite teams are the Steelers, Mets, and Knicks. I am also an animal love; I have two parrots. I love cars as well. I hope you enjoy this site.</p>
